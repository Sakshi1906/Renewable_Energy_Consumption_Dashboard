âš¡ Renewable Energy Consumption Dashboard 

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Built a data pipeline using Snowflake and SQL to clean, transform, and prepare energy consumption data for analysis. Connected the processed data to Tableau to create interactive dashboards that highlight trends, patterns, and key metrics in energy usage.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Snowflake (SQL for transformations and cleaning) 

Tableau (for dashboard and visualization)  

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Trends & Patterns: Identified overall energy consumption trends over time, including peaks and lows.

High vs Low Consumers: Highlighted sectors, regions, or categories with the highest and lowest energy usage.

Opportunities for Optimization: Detected areas where energy efficiency can be improved based on consumption patterns.
